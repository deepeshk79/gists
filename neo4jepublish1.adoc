==Concept : E-Publishing (a graphical approach)

Electronic publishing has become common in scientific publishing where it has been argued that peer-reviewed scientific journals are in the process of being replaced by electronic publishing. It is also becoming common to distribute books, magazines, and newspapers to consumers through tablet reading devices, a market that is growing by millions each year, generated by online vendors such as Apple's iTunes bookstore, Amazon's bookstore for Kindle, and books in the Google Play Bookstore. 
Market research suggests that half of all magazine and newspaper circulation will be via digital delivery by the end of 2015 and that half of all reading in the United States will be done without paper by 2015. 

==Variables

Article - an e-published document
Author - a user of type person who 'Authors' articles
Expert - a user of type person who contributes to an/multiple articles
Media - a user of type media who demand articles and publish them 
Url - the url of a published article
Question - Queries raised/posted by Authors
Quote - Answers posted by Experts to Questions
Status - Status of an article (InProgress, Completed, Published)
Activity TimeStamp - timeline of activities for e.g. when was an article written or conceived, when was it published, who is demanding the article etc.
